title: When does my instance expire?
---

Due to the limited capacity of the cloud infrastructure we have limited the lifetime of instances created with VISA.

### Maximum lifetime

An instance has a maximum lifetime of **14 days** (60 days for staff) afterwhich it will be automatically deleted.

### Inactivity

If the remote desktop of an instance has not been accessed for **4 days** (8 days for staff) it will be deleted.

### Notifications

An email will be sent to you **24 hours** before an instance is deleted. If your instance is due to be deleted because of inactivity, and you wish to keep your instance for more time, you simply need to connect to the remote desktop and this will cancel the deletion procedure.
