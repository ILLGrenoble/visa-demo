title: Managing shared access
---

VISA remote desktops are designed to be shared with other proposal members to facilitate scientific collaboration. The proposal members to whom you can give access depends on the experiments you associated with the instance during its creation. You can also request assistance from scientific and technical staff.

For security reasons, other members can only connect to your instance if you are already connected.

You can manage access to the remote desktop of your instance from the list of instances on the **Home** page.

**Please note**, shared access is only available for remote desktops and is not available for the Jupyter environment.

## Adding an instance member

On the instance you wish to share access, click on the **Settings** button and from there choose the **Members** menu button.

A page will then open allowing you to modify member access to the instance. As mentioned above you can choose either proposal team members or scientific/technical support staff. Select the different members from the drop-down lists. The added member will receive an email notification informing them that they have been added as a member to your instance.

### Access rights

There are two types of access for members to an instance: **Full control** and **Guest**.

### Full control

A member with *Full control* can interact with the remote desktop using the mouse and keyboard and can therefore run applications and perform analysis with equal access rights as the owner.

WARNING: You need to be careful when providing *Full control* to a member as this gives them access to your account on the instance. They can therefore access your private and scientific data. While you have a session open you must be present in front of the desktop at all times. When you disconnect from the instance all other member access rights go to the *Guest* access meaning that they will not be able to control the mouse or keyboard.

### Guest 

A *Guest* member is someone who can observe what you are doing on the remote desktop but cannot interact with it using the mouse or keyboard.

## Removing an instance member

You can remove instance members using the same page. Once a member has been added, they appear in the list at the bottom of the page. Click on the **Remove Member** button to remove them.

## Accessing a shared instance

Instances that have been shared with you are available on the **Home** page in the **Instances shared with me** tab.
