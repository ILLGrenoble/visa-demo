title: What is an instance?
---

An instance is a virtual machine with pre-installed scientific data analysis software, including a Jupyter Notebook server. You can access your instance uniquely through the VISA application which provides you remote access, via any modern web browser, to both remote desktop and JupyterLab environments.

### Remote Desktop

Through the remote desktop you can access your data as well as all the data analysis software you would expect on an standard data analysis machine.

### JupyterLab

You can run Python notebooks using the Jupyter environment running on the same instance as the remote desktop. 

Here you can select the Python Data Analysis environment which comes with a numebr of pre-installed python libraries. This environment also provides with you a simple way of transferring files between your own computer and the VISA instance.
