## JupyterLab file browser

The simplest way of transferring files between the remote instance and your local machine is to use the file browser that is integrated into the JuptyerLab environment. This element supports dragging-and-dropping files from a local file browser (eg *Finder* on Mac, *File Explorer* on Windows, *Nautilus* on Linux) which will then initiate the file transfer.

You can also download files from the remote machine by right-clicking on a file and selected *Download*.
