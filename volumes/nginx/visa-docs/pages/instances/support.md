title: Providing user support
---

VISA provides a means of supporting users by connecting to their remote desktop even if you are not a member of the instance.

There are three types of support users in visa:

 * **Instrument Responsible user**: Can see all instances which have experiments associated to their instrument to be able to provide support for data analysis or experimental control.
 * **Instrument Control user**: Can see all instances for which an experiment is scheduled within a 2 week window (1 week before or 1 week after the current date) to provide assistance to instrument control.
 * **IT Support user**: Can see all instances to provide general assistance.

Depending on your support *role* you will see different instances in the **Support** page. You can also filter the instances by ID, name, owner and instrument.

If a user requires help, you can request access to their desktop while they are also connected (the *Connect* button will not be enabled if they are not connected). In the session activity column you can see when a remote desktop was last open
or how many current users their are. A *mouse* symbol next to the number of active sessions indicates that a user is interacting with the remote desktop through the mouse and keyboard.

When you click on the connect button, the user is presented with a notification indicating that you have requested access and they can chose to accept with *full control* or *read-only access* or cancel the request. 
You can also cancel a request by going back to the *Support* page or your *Home* page.

Please note, if a user asks you for help but they are not in your list of instances, the can add you manually by going in to the *Members* management from the instance *Settings* menu.

Once a user has granted you access to their instance you can proceed to help them either by controlling their instance or explaining to them what they need to do.
