Click on the **Connect** button to access the remote desktop of the instance. The first time you do this may take several seconds. Once the startup of the desktop has completed you will have access to a standard linux desktop and can run all the applications remotely.

### Exiting the remote desktop

To exit from the remote desktop just click on the **Home** menu icon on the left of the screen. Your instance and the desktop session remain active so all applications that you have running will continue to run and any windows that you have open will be available next time you connect.
